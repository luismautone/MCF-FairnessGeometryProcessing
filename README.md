# Mean Curvature Flow for Fairness

The Python script creates a human 3D model that no longer possesses a limb.
The code simulates an amputation through the deformation of the human shape using a <i>mean curvature flow</i>, that has the effect of "smoothing out" the geometry.

The explored method is part of my MSc thesis in Computer Science at Sapienza University titled "Fairness in Geometry Processing".

## Thesis project

The thesis context is <b>Fair Machine Learning</b>, the study of correcting bias respect to sensitive variables in automated decision processes based on ML models.
Generally current human body model generation methods create human bodies compliant with the standard person capabilities and we have very little material on bodies considered a deviation from the norm. The objective is to work on geometric methods that favor a representation of all human bodies in their diversity.

Specifically we focused on the body modeling aspect of Virtual Humans and its creation given by <i>statistical body models</i>, geometric models that describe human pose and body shape in a unified framework through leveraging an encoding for mesh surfaces.
